/**
 *  AKA -> Kadane'e Algorithm
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
 * which has the largest sum and return its sum.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
 * Follow up:
 *
 * If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the
 * divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

         * We have 2 choices:
         * maxEndingHere + nums[i] (extend the previous subarray best whatever it was)
         *  1.) Let the item we are sitting at contribute to this best max we achieved
         *  ending at index i - 1.
         *  nums[i] (start and end at this index)
         *  2.) Just take the item we are sitting at's value.
         * The max of these 2 choices will be the best answer to the Max Contiguous
         * Subarray Sum we can achieve for subarrays ending at index i.
         * Example:
         * index     0  1   2  3   4  5  6   7  8
         * Input: [ -2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ]

         *
         * The best subarrays we would take if we took them:
         * ending at index 0: [ -2 ]           (snippet from index 0 to index 0)
         * ending at index 1: [ 1 ]            (snippet from index 1 to index 1) [we just took the item at index 1]
         *  ending at index 2: [ 1, -3 ]        (snippet from index 1 to index 2)
         * ending at index 3: [ 4 ]            (snippet from index 3 to index 3) [we just took the item at index 3]
         *  ending at index 4: [ 4, -1 ]        (snippet from index 3 to index 4)
         *  ending at index 5: [ 4, -1, 2 ]     (snippet from index 3 to index 5)
         *  ending at index 6: [ 4, -1, 2, 1 ]  (snippet from index 3 to index 6)
         *  ending at index 7: [ 4, -1, 2, 1, -5 ]    (snippet from index 3 to index 7)
         *  ending at index 8: [ 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4 ] (snippet from index 3 to index 8)
         *  Notice how we are changing the end bound by 1 everytime.
         *
         *
         *  (maxEndingHere + nums[i]) will be lesser than nums[i] only when the maxEndingHere is
         *  -ve, that is the sum accumulated till now is -ve so we start over the subarray from
         *  current element.
         *
         *  So the gist of the solution is :
         *  keep accumulating sum till the sum becomes < 0,
         *  at which point you start over again, discarding the accumulated sum.
