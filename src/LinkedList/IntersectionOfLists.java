/**

 *
 * Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
 *
 * For example, the following two linked lists:
 *
 *
 * A:          a1 → a2
 *                    ↘
 *                      c1 → c2 → c3
 *                    ↗
 * B:     b1 → b2 → b3
 *
 * begin to intersect at node c1.
 *
 *  Notes:
 * If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
 * The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
 * You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
 * Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

         * We can use two iterations to do that. In the first iteration, we will reset the pointer of one
         * LinkedList to the head of another LinkedList after it reaches the tail node. In the second
         * iteration, we will move two pointers until they points to the same node. Our operations in
         * first iteration will help us counteract the difference. So if two LinkedList intersects, the
         * meeting point in second iteration must be the intersection point. If the two linked lists have
         * no intersection at all, then the meeting pointer in second iteration must be the tail node of
