/**
 * Given an array of non-negative integers, A, of length N, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.
 *
 * If it is not possible to reach the last index, return -1.
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 * The first and the only argument contains an integer array, A.
 * Output Format:
 *
 * Return an integer, representing the answer as described in the problem statement.
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= N <= 1e6
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 50000
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input 1:
 *     A = [2, 1, 1]
 *
 * Output 1:
 *     1
 *
 * Explanation 1:
 *     The shortest way to reach index 2 is
 *         Index 0 -> Index 2
 *     that requires only 1 jump.
 *
 * Input 2:
 *     A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 *
 * Output 2:
 *     2
 *
 * Explanation 2:
 *     The shortest way to reach index 4 is
 *         Index 0 -> Index 1 -> Index 4
 *     that requires 2 jumps.
